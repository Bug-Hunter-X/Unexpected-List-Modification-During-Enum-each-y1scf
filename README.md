This example demonstrates a common pitfall in Elixir when using Enum.each to modify a list.  The attempt to remove an element from the list within the loop does not affect the original list because Elixir's lists are immutable. The code produces unexpected output because the original list isn't changed within the loop. The solution showcases the correct approach using Enum.filter or Enum.reduce.
